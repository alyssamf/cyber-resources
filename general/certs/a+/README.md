Can purchase Dion and Messer practice exams. Dion has one with his course for free and free quizzes.

My suggestions:
- Watch Messer's free youtube content and join his discord and studying groups.
- Take your own notes use physical flashcards or quizlet and have friends / family quiz you on concepts you are not remembering.
- After completing all lectures, get Messer's practice exams and take these exams like it is a real exam (there is a website that rhymes with bibary genesis that likely has these for free). CompTIA does not release how they grade exams but you should feel confident on these before taking the real deal.
