## Digital Forensics VS Incident Response

Digital forensics involves collecting, preserving, and analyzing forensic evidence from digital devices, typically to present in court as evidence. Think recovering deleted files, images, search history, etc after a crime was committed.

Incident response involves containing, stopping, and preventing a cyberattack. Digital forensics is involved in incident response. Think stopping an attack or malware from spreading, recovering companies deleted or encrypted data. Find out who done it? Where did they do it from? How did they do it? Why did they do it? Stop them and others from doing it again.
